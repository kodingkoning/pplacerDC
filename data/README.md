# Project Data

## Training Data

Use a subset of the RNASim data set aside for testing. To be added.


## Testing Data

For simulated data, we will use the same datasets as APPLES used from Guo et al. (2009), the RNASim-VS sets, except for the data used for testing. These sets are of size 500, 1000, 5000, 10,000, 50,000, 100,000 and 200,000.

We will also use appropriate biological datasets. These still must be selected.

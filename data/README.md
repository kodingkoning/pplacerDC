# Project Data

## Training Data

The training data is the 1000M1 dataset from SATe-I.

K. Liu, S. Raghavan, S. Nelesen, C. R. Linder, T. Warnow, "Rapid and Accurate Large-Scale Coestimation of Sequence Alignments and Phylogenetic Trees," Science, vol. 324, no. 5934, pp. 1561-1564, 19 June 2009.

## Testing Data

The testing data will be the same RNASim-VS datasets as APPLES used from Guo et al. (2009).

Guo S., Wang L.-S., Kim J. 2009. Large-scale simulation of RNA macroevolution by an energy-dependent fitness model. arXiv 0912.2326.

We will also use appropriate biological datasets. These still must be selected.
